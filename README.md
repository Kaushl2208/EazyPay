# EazyPay

   A convenient & secure payment solution for visually impaired for regular Day to day shopping or txn using 2 Step Authorization.


## Technologies Used


  * Image recognition using Tensorflow :To identify the individual(visually impaired)
  * Microsoft Speaker recognition API :To recognise the same individual
  * FrontEND -HTML,CSS,JS
  * BAckend- PHP



## What it is going to do?


   As a blind person or visually impaired it is not safe or convenient to carry cash or card with them.So this platform will help both impaired person and cashier for the completion of a successfull and secure txn.


## How it will work?


    At the cash counter the app will be deployed on their computers.When a blind person want to buy something,during checkout he will order the product he want to purchase.The cashier will scan every product which the app will feed.The blind person will repeat his unique identification id which the computer will feed and recognise him from the server.The app will then take the picture of the user through webcam and will authenticate the user. Now the app will speak all the products one by one with its price and the user will confirm the same.After the confirmation the app will give the final price and the user will confirm the same.The app will then ask for the checkout and passcode which will be given by the user after all the cases to be passed the transaction will take place.

    Alternatively if the user find that their is something wrong or he is forced to do the txn. then he have to enter a alternate passcode which will redirect a  emergency call or mesg to police station and one emergency contact which will keep the txn more safer.
